## Project: Debrief Extension PR Preview Hosting with Fly.io

This document tracks all implementation work completed on the project following the APM framework.

---

## Phase 1: Bootstrap Environment - Docker Infrastructure Setup

**Task Reference:** Phase 1: Bootstrap Environment in [Implementation Plan](docs/debrief-pr-preview-implementation-plan.md)

**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Assigned Task:** Complete Bootstrap Environment for Fly.io Deployment  
**Implementation Agent:** Task execution completed

### Actions Taken

1. **Verified Existing Project Structure**
   - Confirmed VS Code extension builds successfully with `npm run compile`
   - Validated existing workspace files: boat1.rep, boat2.rep, sample.plot.json, large-sample.plot.json
   - Reviewed package.json configuration including custom editor for .plot.json files
   - Extension includes Plot JSON Viewer, Hello World commands, and Leaflet dependency

2. **Created code-server Dockerfile**
   ```dockerfile
   # Key components of the Dockerfile:
   FROM codercom/code-server:latest
   # Installs Node.js 18.x for extension building
   # Builds VS Code extension and packages as .vsix
   # Installs extension in code-server
   # Copies workspace files and creates helpful README
   # Configures code-server with no authentication for public access
   # Exposes port 8080 and starts with workspace pre-loaded
   ```

3. **Added Docker Support Files**
   - Created comprehensive .dockerignore file
   - Excludes unnecessary files: node_modules, .git, docs, prompts, development files
   - Optimizes build context size and build speed

### Key Decisions Made

- **Base Image:** Used `codercom/code-server:latest` for stability and maintenance
- **Node.js Version:** Installed Node.js 18.x for compatibility with modern VS Code extensions
- **Authentication:** Disabled authentication (`--auth none`) for public accessibility as per SRD requirements
- **Workspace Setup:** Pre-loads existing sample files and creates informative README for users
- **Extension Installation:** Uses vsce to package and install extension during build process
- **Port Configuration:** Exposes port 8080 as standard for code-server deployments

### Challenges Encountered

- Docker daemon not running in development environment prevented local build testing
- Worked around by validating Dockerfile syntax and following code-server best practices
- Will require CI/CD pipeline testing to verify Docker build functionality

### Deliverables Completed

- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Complete code-server setup with Debrief extension integration
- ✅ `.dockerignore` - Optimized build context configuration  
- ✅ Verification that extension builds correctly (`npm run compile` successful)
- ✅ Documentation of Docker configuration decisions

### Confirmation of Successful Execution

- VS Code extension compiles without errors
- Dockerfile follows code-server best practices and includes all required components
- .dockerignore optimizes build context for CI/CD efficiency
- Ready for Phase 2: Fly.io Setup integration

## Phase 2: Fly.io Setup - Infrastructure Configuration

**Task Reference:** Phase 2: Fly.io Setup in [Implementation Plan](docs/debrief-pr-preview-implementation-plan.md)

**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Assigned Task:** Configure the Fly.io infrastructure foundation for deploying code-server instances with the Debrief extension for PR previews  
**Implementation Agent:** Task execution completed

### Actions Taken

1. **Installed Fly CLI and Verified Setup**
   - Successfully installed Fly CLI v0.3.172 at `/Users/ian/.fly/bin/flyctl`
   - Verified CLI functionality and commands available
   - Noted authentication requirement for actual deployments

2. **Created Comprehensive fly.toml Configuration**
   ```toml
   # Key configuration elements:
   app = "pr-template-futuredebrief"
   primary_region = "dfw"
   
   [build]
     dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
   
   [http_service]
     internal_port = 8080
     force_https = true
     auto_stop_machines = "stop"
     auto_start_machines = true
     min_machines_running = 0
   
   [[vm]]
     cpu_kind = "shared"
     cpus = 1
     memory_mb = 1024
   
   [env]
     PASSWORD = ""
     SUDO_PASSWORD = ""
     DISABLE_TELEMETRY = "true"
     TZ = "UTC"
   ```

3. **Implemented Dynamic PR App Template System**
   - Created `fly-template.toml` with placeholder substitution system
   - Supports naming pattern: `pr-<pr_number>-futuredebrief`
   - Template includes PR_NUMBER environment variable for identification
   - Ready for CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions

4. **Developed Deployment and Cleanup Scripts**
   - **`scripts/create-pr-app.sh`**: Automates PR app creation with proper naming
   - **`scripts/destroy-pr-app.sh`**: Handles app cleanup when PRs close
   - Both scripts include error handling and user feedback
   - Made executable and ready for CI/CD integration

5. **Verified Docker Compatibility with Fly.io**
   - Successfully built Docker image locally: `docker build -t debrief-extension-test .`
   - Confirmed extension packaging and installation works correctly
   - Validated that code-server starts properly with pre-loaded workspace
   - Fixed TOML syntax issues for proper Fly.io configuration parsing

### Key Decisions Made

- **Resource Allocation:** 1 CPU, 1024MB memory for cost-effective code-server operation
- **Auto-scaling:** Configured machines to auto-stop when idle (cost optimization)
- **Security Model:** Public access with no authentication for ease of testing
- **Naming Convention:** `pr-<pr_number>-futuredebrief` pattern for clear PR identification
- **Region Selection:** Dallas (dfw) for optimal US performance
- **Stateless Design:** No persistent storage to ensure clean environments per deployment

### Challenges Encountered

- **Authentication Requirement:** Fly CLI requires authentication for actual deployments
- **TOML Syntax Issues:** Initial configuration had type mismatches and invalid sections
- **Configuration Complexity:** Simplified from advanced features to essential functionality
- **Template System:** Developed placeholder substitution approach for dynamic app creation

### Deliverables Completed

- ✅ `fly.toml` - Complete Fly.io configuration ready for deployment
- ✅ `fly-template.toml` - Template for dynamic PR-based app creation  
- ✅ `scripts/create-pr-app.sh` - Automated PR app creation script
- ✅ `scripts/destroy-pr-app.sh` - Automated PR app cleanup script
- ✅ `docs/flyio-setup.md` - Comprehensive documentation of setup process
- ✅ Docker build verification with Fly.io compatibility confirmation

### Confirmation of Successful Execution

- Fly CLI installed and operational
- Complete `fly.toml` configuration supports dynamic PR deployments
- Template system ready for CI/CD automation with proper naming conventions
- Docker build verified compatible with Fly.io deployment requirements
- Helper scripts provide automated deployment/cleanup functionality
- Comprehensive documentation enables Phase 3 (CI/CD Integration)
- Configuration optimized for cost while ensuring good performance
- Ready for GitHub Actions Secret (`FLY_API_TOKEN`) integration
