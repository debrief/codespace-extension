    // Integrates with VS Code's document management system
}
```

**GeoJSON Manipulation:**
```typescript
// Complete feature management with ID-based operations
private generateFeatureId(): string {
    return 'feature_' + Date.now() + '_' + Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 11);
}

private isValidFeatureCollection(data: any): boolean {
    return data && typeof data === 'object' && 
           data.type === 'FeatureCollection' && 
           Array.isArray(data.features);
}
```

**Python API Examples:**
```python
# Complete API usage examples:
fc = get_feature_collection("sample.plot.json")
set_selected_features("sample.plot.json", ["feature_id_1", "feature_id_2"])
add_features("sample.plot.json", [new_feature])
update_features("sample.plot.json", [modified_feature])
delete_features("sample.plot.json", ["feature_to_remove"])
zoom_to_selection("sample.plot.json")
```

**Webview Integration:**
```javascript
// Enhanced webview message handling
function zoomToSelection() {
    if (highlightedLayer) {
        map.fitBounds(highlightedLayer.getBounds());
    } else if (geoJsonLayer) {
        map.fitBounds(geoJsonLayer.getBounds());
    }
}
```

### Architecture Integration Points
