## Phase 1: Bootstrap Environment - Docker Infrastructure Setup

**Task Reference:** Phase 1: Bootstrap Environment in [Implementation Plan](docs/debrief-pr-preview-implementation-plan.md)

**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Assigned Task:** Complete Bootstrap Environment for Fly.io Deployment  
**Implementation Agent:** Task execution completed

### Actions Taken

1. **Verified Existing Project Structure**
   - Confirmed VS Code extension builds successfully with `npm run compile`
   - Validated existing workspace files: boat1.rep, boat2.rep, sample.plot.json, large-sample.plot.json
   - Reviewed package.json configuration including custom editor for .plot.json files
   - Extension includes Plot JSON Viewer, Hello World commands, and Leaflet dependency

2. **Created code-server Dockerfile**
   ```dockerfile
   # Key components of the Dockerfile:
   FROM codercom/code-server:latest
   # Installs Node.js 18.x for extension building
   # Builds VS Code extension and packages as .vsix
   # Installs extension in code-server
   # Copies workspace files and creates helpful README
   # Configures code-server with no authentication for public access
   # Exposes port 8080 and starts with workspace pre-loaded
   ```

3. **Added Docker Support Files**
   - Created comprehensive .dockerignore file
   - Excludes unnecessary files: node_modules, .git, docs, prompts, development files
   - Optimizes build context size and build speed

### Key Decisions Made

- **Base Image:** Used `codercom/code-server:latest` for stability and maintenance
- **Node.js Version:** Installed Node.js 18.x for compatibility with modern VS Code extensions
